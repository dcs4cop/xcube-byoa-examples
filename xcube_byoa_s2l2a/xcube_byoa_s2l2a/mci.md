## Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) for Sentinel-2 L2A

This example algorithm implements the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI)
for Sentinel-2 L2A data. It is a simple water quality index
that exploiting the deviation of a spectral center band 
from a baseline defined by two other spectral bands.

It can be used to identify and characterize algol blooms in oceans and 
inland waters.

This implementation expects as input a Sentinel-2 L2A data cube 
as provided by the Sentinel Hub API. This data cubes can be obtained 
either through 
* a dedicated xcube data store as provided by the `xcube-sh` plugin; 
* or generated by the xcube Generator Service. 
 
The output is a copy of that data cube including a new variable `MCI`.
